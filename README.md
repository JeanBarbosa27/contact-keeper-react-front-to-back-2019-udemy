## About

The main goal of the project is creating a simple CRUD to manage contacts, using React, to show how to use Context API to handle state through the application, integrating it with a simple API built in Node and Express and, finally, persisting data into MongoDB.

## Requirements

In order to run this project locally, you'll need to install some dependencies, listed below.

- [Node on version 18.3.0 at least](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Besides of it, you'll need to duplicate the `.env.sample` file, rename it for `.env` and fill it's envirorment variables (ask for some one who has it).

## Running locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so to run it in your machine, you can use the scripts below.

- `npm run dev`: Runs both API and Client servers and connects backend with MongoDB;
- `npm run start`: Runs only the API server;
- `npm run client`: Runs only the Client server and get it ready on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000);
- `npm install`: Install the dependencies for backend only;
- `npm run clientinstall`: Installs the dependencies for frontend only;

## Deploy

**Cooming soon**
